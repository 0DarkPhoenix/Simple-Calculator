# Simple Calculator
### ðŸš§ Under development ðŸš§
A calculator application aiming to provide a cross-platform calculator to satisfy both simple and advanced users by using a simple design but striving to add as many features from a graphical calculator as possible.

This application will be compiled to be used on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, IOS and Android using [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/).

## Distinctive Features
- Renders math expressions like a graphical calculator using [Katex](https://katex.org/)
- Cursor to move between numbers and operators to be able to edit on specific spots
- Split buttons for the graphical calculator to input extra operators without needing a "2nd" or "shift" state to display extra operators
- Shortcut combinations to input operators that aren't available on the numpad:
  -  `**` -> `^` (exponentiation)
  -  `//` -> `%` (modulo)
  -  `/*` -> `âˆš` (square root)
- 'Sequences' tab to calculate numbers from sequences like the Fibonacci sequence, prime numbers, and factorial numbers
